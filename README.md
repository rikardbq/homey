### For touch screen PC / PC tablet / TV hooked up to PC

- The intention of this application is to display apps in a touch friendly manner. 
- Currently, in my experience the Windows 11 interface is the anti-thesis to its own touch PC tablet products.
- Future additions will include custom mouse pointer for navigation with a xbox controller or similar on websites that are linked to through this app
